"""
   The polynomial class is not intended to solve polynomial operations. Though it does offer limited functionality in that department.
   The purpose of this class is to organise the concept of a polynomial in a way that makes question development easier.
   
   The addition and multiplication operators do work (at least for simple polynomials) however they are not efficiently implemented.
   If a question involves subtracting one polynomial from another, add two polynomials and use the answer in the question.
   
   This is a trend throughout both this class and other math_blocks classes. If a question involves dividing, you should multiply and
   then reverse engineer the question. If you want a question to ask about the roots of a polynomial, create roots first, then construct
   your polynomial around them.

   The proper use of the functionality is generally to generate an answer and then reverse engineer the question.
   
   This is a simple learning tool - any other expectations will lead to unholy rage.
